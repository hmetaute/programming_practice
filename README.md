Welcome to this programming practice!

This is a java project intended as a simple exercise.

Basically you can pass an integer to the IntFormatter
and it will return the String representation (in english) for your number!

As simple as that.

In order to build this project:

With maven installed just do
`mvn clean install`

To run the tests
`mvn test`

if you want to create an executable jar
`mvn package`
